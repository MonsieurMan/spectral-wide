# Spectral Wide _(beta)_

## Screenshots
> Coming later.

## Philosophy
Spectral Wide's goal is to provide developper with: 
- **Wide color spectrum** for meaningful contrast between semantically different concept, helping focusing on what you're after.
- **Darkness** for our eyes.
- **Joy**, **Swag**, _And a lot more..._

## Color palette
The theme currently uses colors from the material palette as they are colorful while not being agressive and also providing good contrast between each others.
> Also add pictures ?

## Languages supported
- Typescript _(in progress)_
- HTML _(not started)_
- SCSS _(not started)_
- Markdown _(not started)_
- Javascript _(not started)_

## Roadmap
- [ ] Typescript support.
- [ ] Pre-processor for easily generating theme with a color palette.
- [ ] Extension rating prompt and other little tricks.

### Tips and tricks
You can use the `Developer: Inspect TM Scopes` command from the Command Palette `(Ctrl+Shift+P)` to inspect the scopes of a token at the cursor and to see which theming rule has been applied.
