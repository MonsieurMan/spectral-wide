# Spectral Wide _(beta)_
Spectral Wide is a color theme originally based on Gotham Theme by @alireza94.  
The goal of the theme is to provide **high contextual contrast**, and to help **focusing** on what **matters** in the code.  

The theme uses colors from the material palette as they are colorful while not being agressive. They also provide good contrast between each others.

The theme is currently in beta, support is in progress for _(in order)_: 
- typescript _(known to be tricky with vscode...)_
- html
- css
- javascript

If you like the theme any form of support or help is appreciated.
